        or more than 30 years LIBERO has continued to provide library software that supports the needs of hundreds of libraries worldwide.

        Developed in collaboration with librarians, the LIBERO product range has evolved with industry needs to include customisable discovery, 
        consortia and mobile-friendly solutions that are interoperable with the core LIBERO LMS (library management system). 
        Built from the ground-up to be entirely accessible through a web browser, each solution has been developed to optimise flexibility for the library, 
        minimise click-through and maximise the useability of information services for users.

        LIBERO customers also benefit from a local, Australian-based Support Team and dedicated Help Desk. 
        Our customers enjoy direct involvement in product direction via an active User Group and regular Development Group meetings.
